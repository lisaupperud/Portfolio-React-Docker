# Portfolio-React

Portfolio project for Cloud Services course. Features my projects and technical skills that I've learnt throughout school. Although it showcases my skills and projects, it's main purpose is to showcase that I know how to deploy a dockerized web app in Azure, which is why it showcases the steps I've taken to deploy it.

You can find the static web app on this URL:
